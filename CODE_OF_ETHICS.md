**BlackVideo (Codename: Zephyra)**

---

## I. Preamble

BlackVideo is a modern multimedia platform built with the belief that software has a **real impact on people, culture, and society**.
As developers, contributors, and collaborators, we recognize that our decisions influence user trust, safety, creativity, and access to information.

This **Code of Ethics** defines the principles that guide how BlackVideo is designed, developed, maintained, and shared.
It serves as a framework for **ethical decision-making**, professional conduct, and accountability across the BlackVideo ecosystem.

This document applies to:

* Core maintainers
* Contributors and developers
* Partners and extension authors
* Anyone acting on behalf of the BlackVideo project

---

## II. Fundamental Principles

### 1. Public Interest

We place the **public good, user safety, and societal impact** above all other interests.

**Commitments:**

* Avoid building or enabling features that knowingly cause harm, abuse, or exploitation
* Respect user privacy, consent, and autonomy
* Promote accessibility, fairness, and inclusivity in design
* Disclose known risks, limitations, or potential harms honestly
* Cooperate with lawful and ethical concerns related to public safety

BlackVideo is **not designed to facilitate illegal content, copyright abuse, or user surveillance**.

---

### 2. Users & Clients

We respect users as the **primary stakeholders** of BlackVideo.

**Commitments:**

* Protect user data and privacy by default
* Be transparent about data usage, storage, and permissions
* Avoid deceptive UI, dark patterns, or forced behaviors
* Clearly communicate limitations, experimental features, and risks
* Treat user feedback, concerns, and reports with respect

Users should always feel **in control**, not exploited.

---

### 3. Tools & Technologies We Use

BlackVideo uses modern technologies such as (but not limited to):

* Tauri
* Rust
* React / TypeScript
* Third-party APIs and SDKs
* AI-assisted tools and services

**Commitments:**

* Use tools responsibly and within their licenses and terms
* Avoid dependency misuse, security negligence, or unsafe integrations
* Clearly attribute third-party services when required
* Avoid using illegally obtained software, APIs, or datasets

Tools are means — **ethics guide how they are used**.

---

### 4. Third-Party Services & Providers

BlackVideo integrates with external platforms and metadata providers.

**Commitments:**

* Respect third-party terms of service and legal boundaries
* Clearly distinguish between **metadata**, **links**, and **playback**
* Avoid scraping, bypassing DRM, or violating platform restrictions
* Ensure integrations do not mislead users about content ownership or availability

BlackVideo does **not claim ownership of third-party content or trademarks**.

---

### 5. Developers & Employers

We act in good faith toward contributors, collaborators, and potential employers or partners.

**Commitments:**

* Avoid conflicts of interest
* Be transparent about expectations, ownership, and responsibilities
* Respect contributor time, effort, and intellectual contribution
* Never exploit unpaid labor or misrepresent opportunities
* Ensure equity, collaboration, and trust are earned — not promised vaguely

BlackVideo values **fairness over speed** and **trust over control**.

---

### 6. Product Quality & Responsibility

We strive to maintain **high professional standards** in everything we build.

**Commitments:**

* Prioritize stability, security, and correctness
* Avoid knowingly shipping harmful or deceptive behavior
* Clearly mark experimental or unfinished features
* Maintain accurate documentation
* Accept responsibility for design and implementation decisions

Quality is not optional — it is a **core ethical obligation**.

---

### 7. Professional Judgment & Integrity

All contributors must exercise **independent, honest, and responsible judgment**.

**Commitments:**

* Be honest about limitations, risks, and uncertainties
* Disclose potential conflicts of interest
* Avoid exaggerating capabilities or guarantees
* Resist pressure to compromise ethics for convenience or popularity

Integrity matters more than recognition.

---

### 8. Community, Colleagues & the Profession

We are committed to fostering a **healthy, respectful, and inclusive community**.

**Commitments:**

* Treat colleagues and contributors with respect
* Give proper credit for ideas, code, and effort
* Encourage learning, mentorship, and growth
* Address unethical behavior fairly and responsibly
* Never harass, discriminate, or abuse others

BlackVideo succeeds only if its community remains healthy.

---

### 9. Self-Responsibility & Growth

We commit to **continuous learning and ethical awareness**.

**Commitments:**

* Improve technical competence and professional skills
* Stay informed about ethical risks in evolving technologies (AI, data, media)
* Reflect on the societal impact of our work
* Uphold this Code even when it is inconvenient

Ethics evolve — so must we.

---

## III. Conclusion

BlackVideo is more than a product — it is a responsibility.

By contributing to or representing BlackVideo, we agree to uphold this Code of Ethics and to act with **integrity, transparency, and respect for the public interest**.

We believe that **ethical software is sustainable software**, and that long-term trust matters more than short-term gains.
